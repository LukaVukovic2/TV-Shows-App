# Reflection

This was 4 week long project built during Infinum's React Academy with assistance of mentors. Academy goals included learning and using technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript and CSS. Furthermore, there were homeworks which consisted of multiple assignments that had to be reviewed by mentors upon completing. During the course, Charka UI library was used for styled components.<br>

One of the main challenges was understanding how useSWR(Mutation) hooks work behind the hood and how to render correct data on UI after changing data.
